For as long as we can remember, our country has seen a significant increase in land transactions. These transactions, encompassing buying, selling, and renting of land, have traditionally been handled manually, often involving intermediaries or brokers. This method not only proves to be tedious but also time-consuming. To address this issue, I have devised a technological solution, as outlined below.

# M-ardhi
M-Ardhi is a mobile application designed specifically for Android devices that will allow Kenyan citizens to remotely access listings of land parcels available for sale across the country. Sellers will be able to advertise their land parcels directly on the platform.

The system empowers users (buyers) to search for land parcels that align with their interests, as provided by the sellers. One of its standout features is the integration with Google Maps, allowing potential buyers to view the precise location of a specific land parcel. This feature aids in providing comprehensive details about the land, such as its location, size, fertility, gradient, and proximity to essential amenities. Additionally, with the assistance of GPS, users can quickly identify land sales in their immediate vicinity. Furthermore, for those who have specific areas of interest, they can opt for SMS notifications. Whenever a piece of land is listed for sale in their chosen area, they'll receive an immediate update.

It's anticipated that M-Ardhi will dramatically reduce the time and resources traditionally required to purchase land, making the process more streamlined and efficient for all parties involved.
