Since time in memorial, there have been considerable rise in the number land transactions in our country. These transactions include: buying, selling and renting of land. These transactions are done manually involving middle men (brokers) hence tedious and time consuming. Due this problem, I have come up with a technological solution to solve it as discussed below.
# M-ardhi
Mâ€“Ardhi is an android mobile application that will enable the citizens of Kenya to access land parcels on sale within the country remotely through their mobile phones. The system will contain land parcels advertised by the sellers.
The system will enable users (buyers) to search land parcels of interest posted by the sellers and also show the exact location of a particular piece of land using Google maps to give a clearer picture of a certain parcel in terms of location, size, fertility, sloppiness, closeness to social amenities. The system user will also be able see lands on sale near his/her location via GPS. A sms notification will all be sent to the buyers who subscribed on places of interested, once a land has been advertised on that area. 
It is expected that M-Ardhi will greatly minimize the time and resources used to acquire a parcel of land.
